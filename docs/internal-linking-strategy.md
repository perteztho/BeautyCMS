- No cross-linking between related content

**Recommendations:**
- Add contextual links within hero section content
- Include "Related Resources" sections
- Link to current alerts from statistics section

**Implementation:**
```jsx
// Enhanced hero section with contextual links
<p className="text-xl md:text-2xl mb-8 max-w-3xl mx-auto">
  Protecting our community through comprehensive{' '}
  <SEOLink 
    href="#resources" 
    className="text-yellow-300 hover:text-yellow-100 underline"
    title="Emergency preparedness resources and guides"
  >
    emergency preparedness
  </SEOLink>
  ,{' '}
  <SEOLink 
    href="#alerts" 
    className="text-yellow-300 hover:text-yellow-100 underline"
    title="Current disaster alerts and warnings"
  >
    rapid response
  </SEOLink>
  , and community recovery initiatives.
</p>
```

### 2. Topic Clustering Strategy

**Primary Clusters:**

1. **Emergency Preparedness**
   - Hub: /resources
   - Spokes: /news (preparedness articles), /gallery (training photos), /contact (DRRM team)

2. **Current Alerts & Response**
   - Hub: /alerts
   - Spokes: /map (evacuation centers), /report (incident reporting), /contact (emergency contacts)

3. **Community Engagement**
   - Hub: /news
   - Spokes: /gallery (activity photos), /resources (related guides), /contact (feedback)

### 3. Anchor Text Variations

**Emergency Preparedness:**
- Primary: "emergency preparedness"
- Variations: "disaster preparedness", "emergency planning", "preparedness resources", "how to prepare for disasters"

**Evacuation Centers:**
- Primary: "evacuation centers"
- Variations: "emergency shelters", "safe evacuation areas", "evacuation sites near you", "emergency accommodation"

**Disaster Alerts:**

### 4. Breadcrumb Implementation

// Breadcrumb structure for different pages
const breadcrumbExamples = {
  alerts: [
    { label: 'Home', href: '/' },
    { label: 'Current Alerts', href: '/alerts', current: true }
  ],
  resources: [
    { label: 'Home', href: '/' },
    { label: 'Resource Hub', href: '/resources', current: true }
  ],

    { label: 'News', href: '/news' },
    { label: 'Article Title', href: '/news/article-slug', current: true }
  ]
};
```

### 5. URL Structure Best Practices

- `/resources` - Simple, memorable
- `/contact` - Standard convention

**Recommended Improvements:**

- Use descriptive slugs: `/evacuation-centers/pio-duran-elementary`

**URL Guidelines:**
- Use hyphens instead of underscores
- Keep URLs under 60 characters when possible
- Include target keywords naturally
- Avoid dynamic parameters for main content

### 6. Link Attributes Best Practices

**Internal Links:**
```html
<a href="/alerts" 
   title="Current disaster alerts and emergency warnings"
   aria-label="View current disaster alerts">
   Current Alerts
</a>
```

**External Links:**
```html
<a href="https://pagasa.dost.gov.ph" 
   target="_blank" 
   rel="noopener noreferrer"
   title="PAGASA Weather Updates">

```
